  "response": "Nutritionally, mango and watermelon both offer hydration and valuable vitamins, but they differ in their key strengths. Watermelon is exceptionally hydrating (92% water) and lower in calories (46 calories per cup), providing a significant amount of the antioxidant lycopene, which is linked to heart health, and citrulline, which may aid exercise recovery. Mango is richer in calories and carbohydrates, offering more fiber (1.6g per 100g) and a broader range of vitamins—it's an excellent source of vitamins C and A, and also provides folate, vitamin E, and unique antioxidants like mangiferin. In summary, watermelon excels in hydration and specific phytonutrients, while mango offers more fiber and a wider array of vitamins and antioxidants.",
